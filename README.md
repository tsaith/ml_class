Here are the programming exercises done by myself for this class. <br/>
All codes were written with Octave/Matlab.

ex1: Linear Regression. <br/>
ex2: Logistic Regression. <br/>
ex3: Multi-class Classification and Neural Networks. <br/>
ex4: Neural Networks Learning. <br/>
ex5: Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance. <br/>
ex6: Support Vector Machines. <br/>
ex7: K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis. <br/>
ex8: Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems.
